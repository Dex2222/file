        <h1>History of Chess</h1>
        <p>People have been playing chess for more than 1500 years. Invented in India in the 6th century CE, its earliest known form was called chaturanga. The pieces originally represented the military units common in warfare at that time: infantry, cavalry, elephants, chariots, a general, and a king. The game spread from India to Persia in the 7th century and then westward to the wider Muslim world following the Islamic conquest of Persia. Islamic influence then spread the game to southern Europe, reaching western Europe by about 1000 CE. An example of an early European chess set is the Isle of Lewis chessmen.<br>

            As chess spread through the Islamic world and then Europe, its rules were modified and pieces were renamed. The modern rules of chess emerged in Italy and Spain by the dawn of the 15th century. Authors began publishing books on chess, and works by chess masters such as Luis Ramierez de Lucena, Ruy Lopez de Segura, and Gioachino Greco influenced the development of the study of chess that persists to this day.<br>
            
            Modern competitive play began in the second half of the 19th century, and early European tournaments featured Romantic masters like Howard Staunton, Paul Morphy, and Adolf Andersson. Jaques of London designed the classic Staunton pattern set around this time, which is still widely in use to this day. The first world chess championship was contested in 1886, with Wilhelm Steinitz emerging victorious over Johannes Zuckertort.<br>
            
            In the 20th century, chess competition became a worldwide affair. The international chess federation, FIDE, was founded in 1924, and it began to administer the world chess championship in 1948. Many strong players contested the world championship, with legends like Mikhail Botvinnik, Mikhail Tal, Bobby Fischer, and Garry Kasparov emerging as victors.<br>
            
            Since 2000, the defining feature of chess is the wide adoption of computer analysis to aid top players in perfecting their games. Computer chess programs originated in the 1970s, and since Deep Blue’s victory over Kasparov in their second match in 1997, players have relied on computer analysis to help them gain an edge over the competition. Online chess competition has also exploded in popularity in recent years, with millions of competitors participating at all skill levels, across the world.</p>
            <h1>Piece movement</h1>
            <h2>Moving and capturing</h2>
            <p>Chess has six types of pieces: the Pawn, Rook, Knight, Bishop, Queen and King. Each piece has its own unique way to move. There are some similarities between the moves of the various pieces. All the pieces except the knight move in a straight line - horizontally, vertically or diagonally. They cannot move past the end of the board and return on the other side. The edge of the board is a boundary which cannot be crossed. All the pieces except the knight may not jump over other pieces - all squares between the square where the piece starts its move and where it ends its move must be empty. The move may not end on a square presently occupied by a piece of the same color.<br>

                If the square where a piece ends its move contains an opponent's piece, the opponent's piece is “captured”, and it is removed from play. All the pieces may be captured except the king. The game ends on the move before the king is captured - “checkmate”. Capturing always requires the attacking piece to land on the square of the opponent's piece while making a normal move. The only exception is for capturing a pawn en passant. You are not required to capture a piece when there is an opportunity to do so, capturing is an option. The only time that capture is required is if the king is under attack and capturing the attacking piece is the only way to stop the attack.<br>
                
                In the picture below, the white rook can move to the right, left, up or down (vertically or horizontally) in straight lines. It can move down and to the right any number of squares until the end of the board is reached. These squares have a green X on them. It can move a maximum of two squares to the left. The remainder of the board is blocked by a piece of the same color, in this case a white knight. The rook cannot jump over the knight to reach the end of the board. It can move only one square up before being blocked by the black pawn. It can capture the pawn by moving two squares up and landing on the pawn, since the pawn is an opposing piece (piece of a different color). This square has a red X on it. It cannot jump over the pawn to reach the end of the board. Therefore, the rook has a total of ten squares where it can go.

            <h3>Pawn</h3>
            <p>pawn is the most numerous and the least powerful piece on the chessboard. Pawns are unusual in their movement. Generally the pawn moves forward only, one square at a time. An exception is the first time a pawn is moved, it may move forward two squares. The pawn cannot jump over other pieces; any piece directly in front of a pawn blocks its advance to that square. The pawn is the only piece that cannot move backward. The pawn is also the only piece that does not capture in the same way that it moves. The pawn captures an opposing piece by moving diagonally one square - it cannot capture by moving straight ahead.<br>

            In the picture below the lower pawn is still on its original square, so it may move one or two squares forward (indicated by the green X). It may capture by moving to the right or left at a diagonal, but only if that square is occupied by an opposing piece (indicated by the red X). Otherwise, it may not move diagonally. The upper pawn has already moved from its original square. It may move only one square forward. Likewise, it can capture moving to the left or right diagonally if the square contains an opposing piece.

            <p>The pawn also is involved in two special moves. The first is the en passant capture where a pawn is captured on its initial two square move. The second is the pawn promotion where a pawn is promoted to another piece when the pawn reaches the other end of the board.</p>

            <h3>Bishop</h3>
        <p>The Bishop moves in a straight line diagonally on the board. It can move as many squares as wanted, until it meets the end of the board or another piece. The bishop cannot jump over other pieces. The bishop captures on the same path it moves, by landing on the square of the opposing piece. Because of the way the bishop moves, the piece always remains on the same color squares it started on. Each player begins with two bishops, one on the black-colored and one on the white-colored squares. They are frequently referred to as the “dark-squared” bishop and “light-squared” bishop. The bishops can also be named according to the side they begin on - king's bishop and queen's bishop.</p>

        <h2>Rook</h2>
        <p>The rook moves in a straight line either horizontally or vertically through any number of unoccupied squares, until it reaches the end of board or it is blocked by another piece. It cannot jump over other pieces. The rook captures on the same path it moves, by occupying the square on which an enemy piece stands. The rook can land on any square on the board, therefore it is one of the more powerful pieces on the board.

        <p>The rook is also involved in a special move. It is the castling move where a rook and the king are grouped into a defensive position.</p>

        <h3>Knight</h3>
        <p>The Knight is the most special piece in chess, having a flexibility that makes it a powerful piece. The knight is the only piece on the board that may jump over other pieces. The knight moves two squares horizontally or vertically and then one more square at a right-angle. The knight’s move is shaped as an “L”. The knight always lands on a square opposite in color from its initial square. The knight can jump over pieces of either color while going to its destination square, but it does not capture any pieces it jumps over. The knight captures by landing on the square of the opposing piece. The knight cannot land on a square occupied by a piece of the same color. Since the knight's movement is not in a straight line, it can attack a queen, bishop, or rook without being reciprocally attacked by that piece.

        <h3>Queen</h3>
        The Queen is considered the most powerful piece on the board. It can move any number of squares in a straight line - either vertically, horizontally or diagonally. The queen moves like the rook and bishop combined. Unless capturing, the queen must move to an unoccupied square; and it cannot jump over pieces. The queen captures on the same path it moves, by landing on the square of the opposing piece.

        <h3>King</h3>
        <p>The King is the most important piece in chess. If the king is trapped so that its capture is unavoidable, the game is over and that player loses. The king has little mobility, so it is also considered one of the weakest pieces in the game. The king can move to any adjacent square. That is, it can move one square in any direction: horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. It cannot move onto a square occupied by a piece of the same color. The king captures another piece in the same way it moves, by landing on the square of the opposing piece. There is an additional limit on the movement of the king. The king may not move to a square which would put the king under attack by an opposing piece (called in “check”). As a result of this limit, two kings may never stand next to each other - since moving next to the opposing king would put the moving king into check. The king can also be forced to move or capture if the king is under attack (“check”) and the only way to stop the attack is to move the king.

        <h1>What are special moves in chess?</h1>
        <p>Special moves are those that allow different types of movement or capture when compared to standard movements. There are only a few of these to learn, but they are extremely important to know!<br>

            When learning how to play chess, most people focus on the basic movements of the pieces and what it means to give or receive a check or checkmate. These rules usually cover most games between beginners, but the time comes when you (or your opponents) have the possibility of playing a special move. Those moves are castling, promoting a pawn, and capturing en passant.</p>
            <h2>Castling</h2>
            <p> is the only move in chess that allows a player to move two pieces simultaneously—the king and a rook. It's also a crucial move because it helps you keep your king safe and quickly develop a rook.</p>   
            <embed style="width: 720px; height: 450px;" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4jXQyGaeUV8"></embed>
            <p>When castling is allowed, you can move your king two squares to the side, grab the rook from the side you're castling to, and place it over and next to the king. You can watch the video or follow the link above to find out when you're allowed to castle.</p>
            <img src="https://images.chesscomfiles.com/uploads/v1/images_users/tiny_mce/PedroPinhata/phpKmrFbv.gif" height="50%" width="50%">

            <p>You can castle kingside (also known as "castling short") if your king moves to the side that's closer to the board's edge, or queenside (also known as "castling long") when you do it to the other side.</p>
            <img src="https://images.chesscomfiles.com/uploads/v1/images_users/tiny_mce/PedroPinhata/phpIT1Q1d.gif" height="50%" width="50%">

            <h2>Pawn Promotion</h2>
            <embed style="width: 720px; height: 450px;" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/sGIQWJudCaI"></embed>
            <p>Pawn promotion is probably the special move that most beginners know exists, although there's usually some confusion as to how it truly works. This rule allows a pawn to become any piece (other than a king or staying a pawn) when it gets to the farthest rank from where it started (eighth for White and first for Black).<br>

                You don't need to promote your pawn to a piece that was previously captured—a common misconception among some players who are still learning the game.</p>
            <img src="https://images.chesscomfiles.com/uploads/v1/images_users/tiny_mce/PedroPinhata/phpH4YzZw.gif" width="100$" height="100%">

            <h2>En passant capture</h2>
            <embed style="width: 720px; height: 450px;" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/c_KRIH0wnhE"></embed>
            <p>Beginners are usually startled when they first see an en passant capture—especially when it happens against them. This rule allows pawns on the fifth rank for White and fourth rank for Black to capture another pawn that has just "passed it" in a single move.<br>

                It's the only capture in chess where the capturing piece doesn't land on the same square as the piece it's capturing.</p>
